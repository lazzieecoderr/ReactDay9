What is context, provide, createContext:

createContext():
	A context is created using the createContext function. It returns an object with a Provider and a Consume
Provider:
    The Provider component is responsible for providing the context value to its children. It takes a value prop, which is the data you   want to share.
provide & Multiple (providers & values={[value, setValue  ]} & multiple states

useContext ():
	is used to consume a React context within a functional component.

Avoid props drilling:
	It refers to the process of passing props through multiple layers of React components in order to provide data to deeply nested components.
Disadvantages:
	Maintenance Complexity: If you need to add or modify a prop at the bottom of the component hierarchy, you have to update every    intermediate component.
        Breaking Abstraction: Components in the middle of the hierarchy might receive and pass down props that they don't use
